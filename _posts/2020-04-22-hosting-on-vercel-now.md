It's very easy to host ready jekyll site on vercel.

Vercel was previously called now.sh or zeit...

In fact all what I've done is run `now` in cmd. 
If You don't have now vercel already installed on Your machine You need to do it first.

#### 1. Open command line `cmd` and type `now`
If it doesn't work, you probably need to install now.

#### 1b. Install now
type `npm i now@latest` and it should help. Then return to point 1.

#### 1c. Setup vercel account
You probably need to setup vercel account so follow their guide.

#### 2. Run `now`
In command line in your jekyll project folder  `now`.

I have accepted all default settings and chosen project name as `janheski`. 

After that I had to wait for few minutes but eventually my site was build, deployed and ready automatically on [https://janheski.now.sh](https://janheski.now.sh) :D
