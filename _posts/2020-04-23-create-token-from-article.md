#### 1. Why to create tokens from text?

On one side we have people who create content: blog posts, articles, music or video, and are in need of funds. I think here about artists but also orphanage, non-profit organizations etc. 

On the other hand we have people who would like to support good things. 

Token helps both sides. For content creators such tokens are something they can give as gratitude. For buyers, token is something they can get as souvenir or prove they did good thing. 

Additionally no one is preventing content creators to promise to buy such tokens back in exchange for some other goods. This can work for start-ups as a way to gather funding for their projects.

#### 2. What is StellarLike

That's it. You can now create tokens from any text. With below easy process You can create tokens on Stellar network which will represent your text, is it article or blog post or any content. The only thing is that the length of your content will equal number of tokens created.
