#### 1. Why to create tokens from text?

On one side we have people who create content: blog posts, articles, music or videos, and are in need of funds. I think here about artists but also e.g. orphanage, non-profit organizations etc. They do great work but sometimes all the process to raise funds is overwhelming for them. With such tokens created from text it can be much easier to raise funds. Such token is something that is given as gratitude during payment transaction. 

On the other hand we have people who would like to support good things. For them, tokens are something they can get as souvenir or proof that they did good thing supporting good projects. 

Additionally no one is preventing content creators to promise to buy such tokens back in exchange for some other goods. This can work for start-ups as a way to gather funding for their projects and then give some gifts.

#### 2. How to create tokens from text?

So how to do it? This can be done in multiple ways but in my personal opinion it's nice to have a match between number of characters in content and full number of tokens. For this purpose I've coded helper project in javascript to ease the process of creating such tokens on Stellar Network. I call this type of tokens StellarLike. Let me first explain what StellarLike is and then how to create such tokens.

#### 3. What is StellarLike

StellarLike is token created in tokens on Stellar network which will represent your text, is it article or blog post or any content. The only thing is that the length of your content will equal number of tokens created.

We will now name tokens as assets as this is the term used in Stellar network. 

Generally I have come out with term for this type of assets: StellarLike. StellarLikes are not all same, because you can create different type of StellarLike assets for each article. You can define what name your new asset will have; the tool will propose by default name taken from first 12 alphanumeric characters of your text.
